        <h1>Emphasis and strengthened text</h1>
        <p>Some <em>emphasized</em> and some <strong>strong</strong> text.</p>

        <h2>...Separating content from presentation</h2>
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>The elements in part c are better choice than i and b tags because the computer could already have italics or bold as default fonts, which could make the i and b tags useless. On the other hand,
            strong and em tags are preferable because the computer detects it as something more important rather than just a font style change.
