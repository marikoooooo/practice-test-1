            <p>The difference between writing in google docs and in an html document is as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Google docs has an easier interface for people who aren't very technically literate</li>
                <li>Google docs shows the document as it is, while html documents need a live preview in another tab</li>
                <li>Html documents give users a chance to be more organized with formatting from the backend</li>
            </ul>
